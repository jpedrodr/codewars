Codewars challenge

General notes:

Only supports light mode (it has night mode for future implementation but the layouts won't have decent colors)

All commits done in the main branch: since it's a 1 person repo, no point in creating multiple branches. Also, there are no formal tasks to associate with each branch.

Future implementations:

Handle BE exceptions (such as lack of connectivity, BE unavailable, etc)

Centralize the navigation with fragments

Display loading animation in list fragment

Properly display challenges' completed languages

Tests
