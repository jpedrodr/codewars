Codewars challenge

General notes:

The project itself has no real purpose or requirements. As such, I'll add features and test/use technologies as I see fit

All commits done in the main branch: since it's a 1 person repo, no point in creating multiple
branches.

Future implementations:

Put network logic in module

Put database logic in module

Tests

Paging
