Codewars challenge

General notes:

Only supports light mode (it has night mode for future implementation but the layouts won't have decent colors)

All commits done in the main branch: since it's a 1 person repo, no point in creating multiple branches. Also, there are no formal tasks to associate with each branch.

Since the BE communication was the last part to be started, it was left as a WIP as of 10/06/2022

Future implementations:

Centralize the navigation with fragments

Finish BE communication

Add list support to layouts 

Tests
