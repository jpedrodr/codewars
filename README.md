Codewars challenge

General notes:

All commits done in the main branch: since it's a 1 person repo, no point in creating multiple
branches. Also, there are no formal tasks to associate with each branch.

Future implementations:

Light/dark mode

Put network logic in module

Display loading animation while data hasn't arrived

Centralize the navigation with fragments

Tests
